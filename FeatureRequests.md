# Introduction #

This page lists and describes some features that it would be really nice to have.  Some are more realistic than others, and some will just not be around for a year or so, but here they are!

# Clear/Add Ambiguity #

The "clear" button should implement the thing that was once "new slide", and the "add" button (which was once "new slide") will be "add bookmark".  See the Smart PDF Export section for more information on this.

# Smart PDF Export #

There should be a way to export specified time slices to PDF.  The way we thought of doing this is creating "bookmarks" in the lecture also.  So each "bookmark" will represent a point in time that should be shown in the exported PDF file.
